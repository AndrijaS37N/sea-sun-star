# Days Flutter App
* Called <b>Days</b> because of the Sun animation that goes around for 1 cycle.
* Google's Flutter framework 1.2 version.
* Somewhat clunky to work with, being a fairly new framework.
* Done in VS Code.

More screenshots (mobile and tablet) are below the next chapter.

## Getting Started w/ Flutter

This project is a starting point for a Flutter application.
A few resources to get you started if this is your first Flutter project:

- [Lab: Write your first Flutter app](https://flutter.io/docs/get-started/codelab)
- [Cookbook: Useful Flutter samples](https://flutter.io/docs/cookbook)

For help getting started with Flutter, view our [online documentation](https://flutter.io/docs), which offers tutorials, samples, guidance on mobile development, and a full API reference.

Note: For animations I've posted a comment that has a reference to a nice article about Flutter animations, in the <b>custom_animations.dart</b> file.
